                This is the Fe (Extraverted Thinking) talking. Since he’s an INTP, I feel that too.  I can be mean or rude, but I still feel uncomfortable because I’m aware of it. I agree with him. Although I couldn’t be as rude, since I’d feel too uncomfortable with myself because of my self-awareness and hyper-consciousness. <br><br>But even so, he’s spiteful, he still has that unsettling feeling and thought lingering in the back of his mind. And so that makes you think... is he right, or perhaps, is this the optimal way to handle this problem? 
                <br><br>I think not.

                Same comment about his Fe (Extraverted Feeling). <br><br> He’s an INTP, and his Fe is inferior. That’s why I think he says he couldn’t become an insect: because of his Fe, which lingers in the back of his mind. Given that it’s an immature and inferior function, I presume this is the feeling of discomfort he’s sensing,  and his hyper-consciousness only makes it worse.
                <br><br> I do think most INTPs are like this. What they should do, indeed, is strive to mature and develop their Fe, rather than ignore it like the Underground Man does.

                Could be, yes.<br><br> I’ve read somewhere that consciousness was a mistake, and no one could argue against it. <br> I think it brings more questions and pain than pleasure and answers (not to say that questions are necessarily tied to pain or answers to pleasure, though they can be).<br><br>
                The questions that consciousness brings have no answers, and that frightens and hurts the human mind, especially mine, as I’m too stupid to let go of my thoughts and accept that this world was meant for stupid and delusional men.
                <br><br> Sometimes I get thoughts that shouldn’t even exist in physical form, questions almost from another dimension, as if the universe is speaking through me, and the pain is, indeed, very unsettling. I just have to observe these thoughts, powerless, trapped in a physical body where it’s impossible to change the laws of nature.
                <br><br>
                It’s hard, as I’ve never encountered anyone in my life who thinks or rationalizes like me. Although The Underground Man surprises me with how much my thoughts relate to his. That, however, is quite disturbing, because he doesn’t exactly live a happy or stereotypically fulfilling life.

            <p>Yes, they are,  because they are ignorant. They supposedly came to the possible solution without trying or reflecting on it, as opposed to me, who arrived at the conclusion of the solution through understanding. So, unlike them, I have to go through more “unpaid” work to reach the same supposedly correct solution (if this is actually the solution, though I think and hope it’s not, and that I will change my view). <br><br> As I say, I would rather find the light not through ignorance, but through understanding.
                It feels as if I am mentally disabled, that to reach the same level of ignorant understanding, I have to go through much more work before I can truly start “living.”

                I very much agree with this, and there’s a lot I want to say about it.<br><br>
                I was talking with my girlfriend the other day about how I’d rather the world not be so vast , eight billion people is too much for me to feel important. I feel like nobody. We recently finished Attack on Titan, and I found myself agreeing with Eren: if I had the power, I might do the same. It’s an unpopular opinion, and not one society would accept, but I understand his reasoning.
                <br><br> If there were only a thousand people, or even fewer, I’d feel more important, more purposeful. The more people there are, the less one can accomplish and stand out. There’s genetic potential, yes, and it’s extremely hard to be the “chosen one” among eight billion; far more possible among a thousand. I’d also feel a stronger sense of community.
                <br><br> But the sole biological purpose of life, as Zeke Yeager stated, is to multiply, and while I don’t like that, it’s factual. Does it have meaning? I don’t think so.
                <br><br> Back to the main point,  delusional people believe they can accomplish the impossible, and that comes from sheer ignorance of their limits. Ironically, these are the people who often have a higher chance of succeeding. So I’ve come to a bitter, unpleasant conclusion: it’s best to be delusional and have no doubt in your mind about it. However, I would have to reach that state not through ignorance, but through understanding, by realizing that acting delusional can actually bring the most success.
                <br><br>The problem is, people like me can’t choose to not think like this.

                I find this true, but I think it comes from ignorance and a lack of reflection. I have also found myself guided by spite. For example, when I was arguing with my partner about what Eren was doing with the Rumbling, I thought he was right, but I argued that it didn’t matter if he was right, because I didn’t understand it. I recognize that I didn’t have solid arguments for why he was right.<br><br>
                But if I go deeper (and I may be derailing the subject here), I don’t think in terms of right or wrong. I don’t even believe in these concepts; they’re not universally established, and they’re not written somehow in the universe. It’s hard to explain my thoughts, but the concept of right and wrong doesn’t make sense to me.<br><br>
                Now, you might think: “So you believe killing is right?” Again, I’ve imagined and reflected on that. Let’s start by saying I won’t refer to things as right or wrong, because I don’t believe in them. Would I want to be killed? No, a simple answer. However, I’m not the only one. It’s probable, and almost certain, that every human on this earth does not want to die, like animals.<br><br>
                So we come to a conclusion: if we all don’t want to be killed, let’s not kill each other. That seems like a fair trade, since everyone dislikes it. But there are still people who kill in this world, so how is that possible?<br><br>
                What I’m saying is that we are free to do whatever we want. There is no god or entity stopping us from doing what we want. But just as a man can kill, the police or the law can put him in jail for life or give him the death penalty. They are both acting on their freedom; they are both exercising choice.

            <br><br>
            <p>
                This won’t account for external factors, and so if you want to get the job done well, you would have to not only study the laws of our human brain and our behavior, which I think is almost impossible because there are too many variables.
                <br><br>
                But let’s say it will be done in the future. Since the world is deterministic and everything has a cause, you could theoretically understand and predict what comes next. If this were possible, the present and the future would, in my opinion, become one. You would be able to look one week, a year, or even ten years ahead and know exactly what will happen. Time as we know it, or at least our perception of it, would vastly change and distort.
                <br><br>
                But why would you live then, if you knew you wouldn’t truly be able to choose? You might think you have free will, although that is only a delusion our brain makes us believe. I’m speaking as if this would happen in my lifetime. I think it would distort our view of life and bring more harm than good.
                <br><br>
                Someone might say (or maybe no one would) that this would make us more rational, that it would stop us from acting only in our own interest and allow us to act according to reason and better judgment.
                <br><br>
                Although that might be true, we couldn’t know until we were completely able to predict future events with certainty. But it’s still a very abstract idea. It feels as if I’m trying to play with thoughts in my mind, but they disappear the moment I lose focus. The thing is, why would we even need to find out? It’s not like we could change it. Right?
                <br><br>
                Yet finding this out and “solving the future” would change the direction of the future itself. But in the end, it’s not up to us whether we discover it or not; it will be determined by the universe.
                <br><br>
                Let’s say you could look one year ahead and know exactly what will happen. Wouldn’t that make it easier to change things? For example, if you saw that in one year you would move to another country, you could theoretically decide not to. But that’s not a deterministic view.
                <br><br>
                So there are two possibilities: either no matter how much you try, you will still move countries, or your thinking and desire to change that outcome, whether you succeed or fail, would still be deterministic because it was already intended from the start. If you perfectly understood the laws of nature, you could predict the future and even desire to change it, but that desire would also have been predetermined.
                <br><br>
                The thing is, it’s a paradox. Because if we could truly see the perfect future, then any attempt to change it would contradict the very idea of determinism itself.
